# EEG-Based Hidden Topographical Changes in Depression  
### Complexity and Network Analysis Using Visibility Graphs

This repository contains the complete, reproducible analysis pipeline used in the study:

**“EEG-Based Hidden Topographical Changes in Depression Using Complex Network Dynamics”**

The pipeline integrates EEG preprocessing, signal complexity analysis using the **Hurst exponent (R/S method)**, **Visibility Graph (VG)** construction, graph-theoretic network metrics, hub classification, and frequency-specific network analysis to characterize altered brain connectivity patterns in Major Depressive Disorder (MDD).

## 📌 Overview of the Pipeline

The analysis follows the workflow described in the paper:
